# 📈 Stock Price Predictor

Predict next-day stock price movement using historical OHLCV data.  
This project is part of my AI/ML apprenticeship and focuses on applying core learning techniques to a real-world finance problem.

## 🧠 Overview

This project uses historical stock data to predict whether a stock's closing price will go up or down the next day. It includes:

- Feature engineering on time-series data (lag, returns, volatility)
- Linear Regression model
- Model evaluation 
- Reproducible, modular Python code
- Ready-to-deploy project structure
