# 📈 Stock Price Predictor

Predict next-day stock price movement (up/down) using historical OHLCV data.  
This project is part of my AI/ML apprenticeship and focuses on applying core supervised learning techniques to a real-world finance problem.

## 🧠 Overview

This project uses historical stock data to predict whether a stock's closing price will go up or down the next day. It includes:

- Feature engineering on time-series data (lag, returns, volatility)
- Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation with metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, recall
- Reproducible, modular Python code
- Ready-to-deploy project structure
