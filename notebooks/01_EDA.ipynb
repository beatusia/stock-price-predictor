    "This project applies machine learning to the problem of stock price prediction, with an emphasis on sector-level diversity and company-level representation. The analysis covers all 11 sectors defined by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). For each sector, a leading stock has been selected from a predefined list of 22 well-established and widely traded companies.\n",
